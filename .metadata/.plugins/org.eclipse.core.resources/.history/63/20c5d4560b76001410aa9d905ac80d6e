This program is designed for extracting:
     * ERPRate
     * TimeTravelSet
data sets from LTA (Land Transport Authority, http://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en.html).

Other data sets can be found here:
	http://datamall.mytransport.sg/tool.aspx

In order to extract another data set:
	1)	download a sample data set to find out the fields in the XML file
	2)	create a class for the data set in the XmlClasses package (similar to ERPRate.java and TimeTravelSet.java)
	3)	create a class for data sets in the XmlClasses package (similar to ERPRates.java and TimeTravelSets.java)
	4)	add the following code in (default package) > main.java, just above
